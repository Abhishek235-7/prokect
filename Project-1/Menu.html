            <h3>Web design and development</h3>
            <p>Web design and development is an umbrella term that describes the process of creating a website. ... Web
                design determines the look and feel of a website, while web development determines how it functions.
                Because there isn't always a hard line that separates the two roles, the titles are often used
                interchangeably.</p>
